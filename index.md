## WELCOME TO GREATER TORONTO JIU-JITSU!

Founded by [Shihan Neil Dalgarno](/Instructors) in 1990, Greater Toronto Jiu-Jitsu has become the leading center of Japanese Jiu-Jitsu and Self Defense in the GTA. Neil began his training in Jiu-Jitsu in the 1980's with the legendary Tom Sharkey. After grading for Shodan in 1990, Neil began teaching Jiu-Jitsu in the GTA, most notably at the Toronto Police College. In 2003, Neil was invited to teach at the Centre for Martial Arts in Richmond Hill. Neil, who holds a 6th Dan in Jiu-Jitsu, also has an Honours degree in Kinesiology and a Bachelor degree in Education. Neil has numerous National Coaching Certifications and has coached athletes who have become National team members and Olympic medalists.

[Neil, along with head instructors, Tony Richardson 4th Dan and O'Neil Anderson 4th Dan](/Instructors), have produced some of the country's finest young martial artists. As well as producing a number of Canadian Open Jiu-Jitsu Champions, Greater Toronto Jiu-Jitsu can even boast that Carlos Newton, a Former UFC Champion, is one of its Black Belt graduates!

Our training facilities are world class! Greater Toronto Jiu-Jitsu classes are held at the Centre for Martial Arts, in Richmond Hill, Ontario. Our shared facility boasts, four dojos (training halls), spacious changerooms with showers and a welcoming reception area.

## Curriculum
Having over 30 years of teaching experience in Toronto schools, Shihan Neil incorporates sound pedagogy at every level of Jiu-Jitsu instruction. Also, having special education qualifications, allows him to better serve students of different abilities and challenges.

Greater Toronto Jiu-Jitsu offers separate classes for beginner, intermediate and advance children. After the age of 16, students, regardless of ability are encouraged to attend adult classes. Accommodations are often made to better serve the individual needs of students and parents.


Our Japanese Jiu-Jitsu program allows students to progress through the traditional Japanese grading system. Students begin as white belts and as they gain competency at various belt levels (yellow, orange, green, blue and brown), will after four to five years, earn their Black Belts! All classes emphasize fitness, fun, confidence building and discipline. Adult classes focus on MMA skills and self defense. MMA skills include components of boxing, Muay Thai, judo and BJJ. Our self defense syllabus is similar to police and military programs worldwide.

## Self Defense and Personal Safety Training
Thousands of high school students, professionals and members of the general public, have benefitted over the years from our Self Defense and Personal Safety Seminars. Both Shihan Neil and Renshi Tony worked closely with the Toronto Police Service, as self defense instructors with the “Improve Program”. Neil and Tony were presented with “Certificates of Recognition” by Deputy Chief Sloly.
Self Defense Seminars, group or private lessons are available. Please contact us at greatertorontojj@gmail.com

The Canadian Japanese Jiu-Jitsu Alliance is a governing body, whose aim is to promote excellence in Japanese Jiu-Jitsu. Training seminars and promotions are available throughout Canada to all martial artists who share our passion with Japanese Jiu-Jitsu.

## HISTORY OF JIU-JITSU
Unlike many martial arts, Jiu-Jitsu has not had a neat and well organized history, therefore its roots have been difficult to trace. Mentioned as far back as 2500 years ago, Jiu-Jitsu developed from many individual teachings, either originating in Japan or coming to Japan from other Asian countries. The first formal school opened in 1532 in Japan and the art itself became an important part of samurai training. Jiu-Jitsu is often called the "parent art", since many other arts can trace direct lines to Jiu-Jitsu.

Jiu-Jitsu is one of the most practical and popular martial arts today. It is taught to police and military organizations around the world. The reason for this is simple. Jiu-Jitsu is the original MMA (Mixed Martial Art)! Jiu-Jitsu contains elements of striking, takedowns and grappling, making it the favoured art, not only of professional fighters, but people interested in defending themselves in any situation.
