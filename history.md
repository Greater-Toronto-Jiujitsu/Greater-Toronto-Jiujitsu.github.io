## HISTORY OF JIU-JITSU
Unlike many martial arts, Jiu-Jitsu has not had a neat and well organized history, therefore its roots have been difficult to trace. Mentioned as far back as 2500 years ago, Jiu-Jitsu developed from many individual teachings, either originating in Japan or coming to Japan from other Asian countries. The first formal school opened in 1532 in Japan and the art itself became an important part of samurai training. Jiu-Jitsu is often called the "parent art", since many other arts can trace direct lines to Jiu-Jitsu.

Jiu-Jitsu is one of the most practical and popular martial arts today. It is taught to police and military organizations around the world. The reason for this is simple. Jiu-Jitsu is the original MMA (Mixed Martial Art)! Jiu-Jitsu contains elements of striking, takedowns and grappling, making it the favoured art, not only of professional fighters, but people interested in defending themselves in any situation.
