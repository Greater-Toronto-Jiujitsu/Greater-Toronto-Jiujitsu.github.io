<P>The syllabus used in all our clubs is designed to give students the knowledge of simple, effective, proven techniques to defend themselves against a
variety of attacks. Students will work with a partner to practice a demonstrated technique and as their skills and the number of techniques they have
learnt grow, they will find what works best for them suiting their physical attributes.<BR>Juniors are usually taught separately from the adults and the
syllabus they use has been adjusted from that of the adults as some of the techniques are considered too dangerous due to the lack of maturity.</P>
<P><B>Kyu Grades- The Belts</B><BR><BR>The coloured belts are the student grades referred to as Kyu Grades.
The student will start at the novice white belt and progress through to the Brown belt where they will then be able to be accessed for the Dan grades
(Black Belts.) Each belt has a minimum timescale before a student will be eligible to take a grading (Other factors are considered also, see gradings).
Of course a student can take as long as they want before they grade, although a nudge from the Sensei to encourage you to take the next grading is always
a challenge and helps to focus the mind!</P>
